The Panel Discussion “What makes a good mentor?” was centred around essential topics such as effective communication, establishing clear expectations, providing guidance and delivering constructive feedback. The panelists, experienced mentors and experts in their fields, shared their insights on the role of mentorship, uncovering the challenges and opportunities that come with this impactful relationship.
